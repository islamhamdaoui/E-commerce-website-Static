# Polana Static E-commerce Website

## Overview

This project is a static website created during my second semester last year, in collaboration with a friend. It is an e-commerce website named Polana, featuring several key pages and responsive design elements. Although the site is not fully functional and lacks some dynamic features, it showcases our early work in web development and includes smooth animations and a responsive layout.

## Features

- **Home Page**: A welcoming landing page with basic information about our e-commerce platform.
- **Shop Page**: A product listing page designed to showcase items for sale.
- **Search Page**: A page intended for searching products, though it is currently non-functional.
- **Other Pages**: Additional pages with cool features and designs.
- **Animations**: Smooth hover animations to enhance user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all devices, ensuring usability across desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## Future Improvements

This project is still a work in progress. Future updates will include:
- **Functional Search Page**: Implementing search functionality to enhance user navigation.
- **Dynamic Content**: Integrating backend services to make the shop and other pages fully operational.
- **Enhanced Features**: Adding more interactive elements and refining existing animations.
